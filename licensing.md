# Licensing

Neo4j has several versions:

- Community Edition: open-source, free, GPL v3
- Enterprise Edition is split into three licenses with free and paid tiers:
  - Commercial
  - Developer
  - Evaluation (for deciding whether or not to go for the most expensive plans)
- For those wanting a cloud-based version, they provide a database as a service called AuraDB

## General Public License (GPL)

A GPL allows the user to:

- Use the software for any purpose
- Modify the software
- Share the software
- Commercialise the software (but with the caveat that the source code must be available to the public once any fees are paid)

## Controversies

There have been issues with license interpretation in the past such as this legal battle:

Here, there was a dispute as to whether the GPL could be combined with another clause.
